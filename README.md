## 🛒 Introduction  

Customer segmentation helps businesses identify different customer groups and develop more effective marketing strategies. In this project, we will use the **K-Means clustering algorithm** to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior.  

### 📌 Objective  
- Analyze customers using **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) metrics**  
- Apply the **K-Means algorithm** to identify customer segments  
- Compare K-Means results with rule-based segmentation using RFM metrics  

### 📊 Dataset Used  
- **Online Retail II**: Contains **online sales transactions** of a UK-based retail company between **2009 and 2011**.  
- **Features (Columns)**:  
  - **InvoiceNo**: Invoice number (If it starts with "C", the transaction is canceled)  
  - **StockCode**: Unique product code  
  - **Description**: Product name  
  - **Quantity**: Number of products sold  
  - **InvoiceDate**: Date of transaction  
  - **UnitPrice**: Price of the product (£)  
  - **CustomerID**: Unique customer identifier  
  - **Country**: Customer’s country  

### 🔍 Project Steps  
✅ Clean the data by handling missing and incorrect values  
✅ Calculate **RFM metrics** for customer segmentation  
✅ Apply **K-Means clustering** to group customers  

This project aims to develop an effective **data-driven customer segmentation approach** to better understand customer behavior and improve business decisions. 🚀
